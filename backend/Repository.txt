@Repository
public interface UserRepository extends JpaRepository<UserModel, Long> {

        boolean existsByEmail(String email);
}
so here i do not need to write a sql query the @ repository figures out the query i want based on the function name
ChatGPT
Yes, that's correct.
In Spring Data JPA, you donâ€™t need to write SQL queries for common operations. The @Repository and extending JpaRepository provides default methods like findAll, findById, save, etc. For custom queries, you can define methods by naming them appropriately.

For example, existsByEmail(String email) is a query derived from the method name. Spring Data JPA automatically generates the SQL to check if an email exists in the database based on this method signature.

Can i write any name or is ther a particular template of function names which auto understands required query

There is a naming convention for method names in Spring Data JPA that it uses to automatically generate queries. Here are some patterns:

Find by field:
findBy<FieldName>(...) - Finds entities by a field.
Example: findByEmail(String email)

Exists by field:

existsBy<FieldName>(...) - Checks if an entity with the specified field value exists.
Example: existsByEmail(String email)
Count by field:

countBy<FieldName>(...) - Counts entities with the specified field value.
Example: countByStatus(String status)
Delete by field:

deleteBy<FieldName>(...) - Deletes entities by the field value.
Example: deleteByLastName(String lastName)
Custom queries:

For more complex queries, use @Query annotation.
Example:
@Query("SELECT u FROM UserModel u WHERE u.email = ?1")
UserModel findUserByEmail(String email);

These patterns help Spring Data JPA automatically generate the required queries based on the method names.
